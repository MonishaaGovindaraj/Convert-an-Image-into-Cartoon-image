# Convert-an-Image-into-Cartoon-image
Using OpenCV and Python, an RGB color image can be converted into a cartoon Image
• Convert the original color image to grayscale.	
•	Apply a bilateral filter to reduce the color palette of the image.
•	Apply a median blur to reduce image noise in the grayscale image.
•	Create an edge mask from the grayscale image using adaptive thresholding.
•	Combine the color image from above steps.
